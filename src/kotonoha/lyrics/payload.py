"""Bounds on what an untrusted lyric payload is allowed to cost.

Every provider here fetches from a third party over the network, and one of them
also decompresses what it receives. A timeout bounds how long a response may take,
not how large it may become: a server that streams steadily stays well inside the
limit while the buffered body grows without end, and a compressed body is smaller
still on the wire than in memory. So size is bounded separately, in one place, and
the providers say what they are reading rather than each carrying its own ceiling.
